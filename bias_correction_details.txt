Use N4_th executable file given here to perform the Bias Correction of any input file.

After downloading "N4_th" file, change the file to be executable by: chmod +x N4_th
The bias correction usage command is:
./N4_th <input_image_path> <output_image_path> <threshold_value>
Example, if threshold value is 0.001:
./N4_th input_image.nii output_image.nii 0.001

For the ACDC dataset, we used the threshold value of 0.001, levels as 4, no. of iterations as 50, and did not use any mask information.

If you want to alter the above values, you can check the below link with sample code for bias correction:
